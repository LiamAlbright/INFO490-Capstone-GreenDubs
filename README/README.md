# INFO490-Capstone-GreenDubs
Climate change and environmental issues are arguably the biggest challenges of our era. At GreenDubs We believe that the solution to the environmental crisis can be addressed through a sustained localized community action that involves all of Humanity. An important problematic gap we have identified is that the current platforms and technologies available to citizen science communities/organizations pose a significant challenge to the volunteers due to a lack of effective human-centered design principles. We aim to create a web-based platform that allows for easier data upload, curation, and overall citizen science experience.
